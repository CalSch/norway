Bandy is a sport similar to ice hockey by being played on ice with skates, sticks, and a ball. There are more than 1 million players today and is a sport recognised by the International Olympic Comitte. It's origin is not fully known, but it's rules were first published in England in 1882. It is mostly played in Russia, Sweden, Finland, and Norway, and it has it's own Federation of International Bandy, which was founded by Norway, Finland, and Sweden. Bandy was Folk culture, but recently changed to Pop culture.
